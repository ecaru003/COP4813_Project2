Second Project completed COP 4813: Web Application Programming by professor Gregory Reis. 

Its goal is to create a webapp using Flask(Python)+HTML+CSS in combination with the New York Times API to remotely gather data and present it to the user.

NOTE: Visual polish was never a design goal of this project. Basic functionality was key.
